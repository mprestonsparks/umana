# The Umana Project

"Umana" (אומנא), derived from the Aramaic root אמן (aman), embodies the concept of masterful craftsmanship and skilled creation. In Aramaic literature, particularly the Talmud, an Umana represents more than just a craftsperson - they are a master of their trade who creates with wisdom and purpose.

The term carries deep philosophical significance, representing:
- The bridge between concept and creation
- The perfect execution of plans
- Divine-like craftsmanship
- Wisdom in implementation

This name perfectly captures our framework's essence: an AI system that acts as a master craftsman, bridging the gap between project conception and implementation with wisdom, skill, and trustworthiness.


## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach for AI developers to understand, decompose, and implement software projects. It consists of three core components that work together to enable autonomous software development:

1. Project Definition
2. Task Decomposition Framework
3. AI Coding Agent

The system is designed to be self-improving, allowing the AI developer to enhance and expand the framework's capabilities over time.

## Core Components

### 1. Project Definition

The Project Definition serves as a comprehensive contract that specifies all aspects of the software project. It uses a structured schema that draws from established software engineering principles while being optimized for AI consumption.

### 2. Task Decomposition Framework

The Task Decomposition Framework converts the Project Definition into a structured set of implementable tasks. It combines elements from:

- Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Agile Story Splitting Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### Key Features:

1. **Automated Task Generation**
```python
def generate_tasks(project_definition):
    base_tasks = get_universal_tasks()
    domain_tasks = get_domain_specific_tasks(project_definition.domain)
    arch_tasks = get_architectural_tasks(project_definition.architecturalStyle)
    capability_tasks = get_capability_tasks(project_definition.coreCapabilities)
    
    return compose_task_hierarchy(base_tasks, domain_tasks, arch_tasks, capability_tasks)
```

2. **Dependency Management**
```python
def validate_project_completeness(tasks, project_definition):
    missing_components = []
    for required_component in project_definition.mandatoryComponents:
        if not has_implementation_task(tasks, required_component):
            missing_components.append(required_component)
    return missing_components
```

3. **Implementation Pattern Matching**
```python
def suggest_patterns(project_definition):
    patterns = []
    if project_definition.qualityAttributes['Performance'] == 'Critical':
        patterns.extend([
            'Caching Strategy',
            'Connection Pooling',
            'Async Processing'
        ])
    return patterns
```

### 3. AI Coding Agent

The AI Coding Agent executes the tasks defined by the Task Decomposition Framework. It:

1. Generates code following the specified patterns
2. Maintains project consistency
3. Handles version control and documentation
4. Validates implementation against Project Definition requirements

## AI Planning Methodologies

This section explores key AI planning methodologies that could inform our Task Decomposition Framework:

### Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning

HTN planning is an AI planning methodology that creates plans by task decomposition. It was first introduced in the early 1970s and has been successfully used in various domains.

**Key Concepts:**
- Tasks are decomposed into subtasks until primitive actions are reached
- Planning occurs through recursive decomposition
- Domain knowledge is encoded in methods that specify valid decompositions

**Example:**
```
Task: BuildWebApplication
Methods:
  1. Decompose into:
     - SetupDevelopmentEnvironment
     - ImplementFrontend
     - ImplementBackend
     - DeployApplication

  2. Further decompose ImplementFrontend into:
     - CreateUIComponents
     - ImplementRouting
     - IntegrateWithBackend
```

**Potential Application:**
HTN could be used to create a hierarchical structure of development tasks, with each level becoming more specific until reaching actual implementable units of work.

### STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver)

STRIPS, developed in 1971, is a fundamental automated planning system that introduces a formal language for expressing planning problems.

**Key Concepts:**
- States are represented as sets of logical predicates
- Actions are defined by preconditions and effects
- Planning involves finding a sequence of actions to reach a goal state

**Example:**
```
Initial State:
  - (not (has_database))
  - (not (has_api))
  - (not (has_frontend))

Goal State:
  - (has_database)
  - (has_api)
  - (has_frontend)

Action: CreateDatabase
  Preconditions: (not (has_database))
  Effects: (has_database)

Action: CreateAPI
  Preconditions: (has_database)
  Effects: (has_api)
```

**Potential Application:**
STRIPS could help in determining the correct order of development tasks and identifying dependencies between different system components.

### PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)

PDDL, introduced in 1998, is a standardized format for representing planning problems, building upon STRIPS concepts.

**Key Concepts:**
- Separates domain description from problem description
- Supports typed objects and hierarchical typing
- Allows for complex goal conditions and action effects

**Example:**
```lisp
(define (domain software-development)
  (:requirements :typing)
  (:types
    component - object
    database api frontend - component)
  (:predicates
    (implemented ?x - component)
    (depends-on ?x ?y - component))
  (:action implement
    :parameters (?c - component)
    :precondition (and
      (not (implemented ?c))
      (forall (?dep - component)
        (imply (depends-on ?c ?dep)
               (implemented ?dep))))
    :effect (implemented ?c)))
```

**Potential Application:**
PDDL could provide a formal way to express both the general patterns of software development (domain) and specific project requirements (problem).
